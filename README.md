## Dependencies
Basic MySQL setup is sufficient to run this project.

## Execution
Execution of this script is fairly simple. Run the queries individually or all at once and view the results. Export the data into csv to create visualizations.

## Motivation
The Sakila database is designed by MYSQL as a sample database. This project uses the data and demonstrates business insights from the video rental store's operations. It helps owners understand draw insights into popular film categories, top spending customers, revenue earned across stores or revenue distribution across the world.

This information can help owners in coming up with marketing strategies by giving deeper insights into customer spending patterns, identifying active as well as inactive customers for targeted campaigns and inventory decisions. 

## Results
These insights offer a clear understanding of the data for the store owners. While the repository has access to all queries, below are a few key insights.

1. **Top 10 Customers** – The table shows 10 highest-spending customers at the stores.
