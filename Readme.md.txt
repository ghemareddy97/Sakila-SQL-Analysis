## Motivation
The Sakila database is designed by MYSQL as a sample database. This project uses the data and demonstrates business insights from the video rental store's operations.

## Results
These insights offer a clearer understanding of customer preferences, helping the owners tailor marketing efforts and adjust store inventories toward high-demand film categories.
